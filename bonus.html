        <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, 
            or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, 
            appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the 
            Southern Hemisphere.
