        <h4>The Way Stars Glow</h4>
        <p>Roxva is a Searcher and her mission is to find viable planets for her home, the Queen Ship, to consume.
             If unable to consume enough resources, the Queen Ship will die and bring the people aboard down with 
             her. But Roxva has a secret. She doesn't report the planets that contain large populations of intelligent
             life. As circumstances grow dire aboard the Queen Ship, Roxva must decide how far she will go to protect 
             outsiders.
